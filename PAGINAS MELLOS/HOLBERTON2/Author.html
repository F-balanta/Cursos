					<h1>Masashi Kishimoto</h1>
					<img src="https://nosomosnonos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NSN-portada-masashi-kishimoto-boruto.jpg" alt=""><hr>
					<p>Masashi Kishimoto (岸 本 斉 史, Kishimoto Masashi) (born November 8, 1974 in Nagi) is a popular manga artist. The creator of Naruto is passionate about manga and anime and saw the sagas of Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and all the sagas of him and of which he is a fan. He has been drawing manga since he was in high school. He is the twin brother of another manga artist named Seishi Kishimoto. Everything changed when he started reading Shonen Jump magazine. Kishimoto sent a couple of sleeves to the magazine, but they were rejected. Even so, he continued with his dream without losing his illusion and came up with an idea, a manga apprentice, a ninja apprentice! And that's how his dream came true and how Naruto was born. </p>

					<h2> Inspirations and creation of Naruto </h2>

					<p>As a preschooler, Masashi Kishimoto fell in love with the TV series “Doraemon”; everyone made drawings of his characters. Masashi Kishimoto has created a modern trend in the ancient conception of the Japanese ninja to turn the story into a worldwide success story. So far, it has sold more than 100 million copies. Kishimoto was always a perfectionist; noting the obvious mistakes in other people's drawings and showing them the correct way to draw them. </p>

					<p>Entering his elementary school years, Akira Toriyama's most famous creation, Dragon Ball, became anime and for Kishimoto this meant a whole new interest in the manga and Shonen Jump magazine. Kishimoto and his brother often played games trying to come up with names for their own characters. At the time, the most that came to mind were condiments that he could find in the refrigerator, like "Mustard Man."</p>
					<p>By the end of his primary studies, Masashi Kishimoto was strictly a Dragon Ball fan, he remembers how obsessed he was with Akira Toriyama's work. At this stage in his life, Kishimoto was not allowed to spend 190 Yen on Shonen Jump magazines, and he had to rely on a friend to show him the Dragon Ball chapters. Kishimoto has also declared himself to be the number 1 fan of this series.</p>
					<p>It was at this point in his life that Masashi Kishimoto began to think to himself that "the manga was great" and wished to become a famous mangaka like Akira Toriyama by creating his first manga near this time and entitled "Hiatari-kun ", a story that revolved about" a shadow ninja boy. "</p>
